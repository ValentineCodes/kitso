# Kitso: Mobile Decentralized App Starter Kit for LUKSO

### Project Overview

Kitso is an open-source, up-to-date starter kit designed to streamline the development of mobile decentralized applications (dApps) on the LUKSO blockchain. By providing developers with tools and features like a built-in wallet, contract debugging, and custom hooks, Kitso simplifies the process of building secure and scalable dApps using Hardhat for smart contract development and React Native for mobile application development.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to enhance the mobile development ecosystem within the blockchain space, specifically focusing on improving the experience for developers and users on the LUKSO blockchain. Kitso aims to empower developers to easily build mobile-first dApps that prioritize security, usability, and scalability.

### Problem Statement

While decentralized applications (dApps) are transforming the way we interact with technology, the mobile experience lags behind, particularly on the LUKSO blockchain. A lack of mobile-friendly tools and secure wallets has hindered broader adoption. Developers also face challenges in efficiently managing smart contracts and building user interfaces for mobile platforms, resulting in suboptimal dApp experiences for users.

### Proposed Solution

Kitso offers a comprehensive solution tailored to the LUKSO blockchain, integrating key development features into one cohesive package:

![Wallet](https://valentinecodes.github.io/kitso/assets/wallet.png)
üí≥ **In-Built Wallet:** A secure crypto wallet to manage funds, and sign transactions on LUKSO, providing a seamless and intuitive mobile experience for LUKSO users.

‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload:** Automatically updates the frontend to reflect real-time changes in smart contracts deployed on LUKSO, reducing downtime and speeding up the development process.

![Contract Debugger](https://valentinecodes.github.io/kitso/assets/debugger.png)
üõ†Ô∏è **Contract Debugger:** A powerful tool to debug smart contracts on LUKSO, ensuring they function as expected before deployment.

ü™ù **Custom Hooks:** A collection of TypeScript-enabled React hooks to simplify interactions with LUKSO smart contracts, enabling developers to write cleaner, more efficient code.

üß± **Components:** Pre-built web3 components tailored for LUKSO, allowing developers to quickly assemble user interfaces and focus more on functionality rather than building from scratch.

By integrating these features, Kitso provides a frictionless mobile dApp development experience on the LUKSO blockchain, significantly enhancing both developer productivity and user satisfaction.

### Project Roadmap

**Phase 1: Initial Development (Completed)**

- Core features implemented, including in-built wallet, contract hot reload, custom hooks, and web3 components.

**Phase 2: Community Feedback & Refinement (Next 3-6 months)**

- Gather feedback from early adopters and refine features
- Extend mobile wallet functionality.
- Extend supported development tools

**Phase 3: Expansion and Integration (6-12 months)**

- Introduce more advanced debugging tools.
- Build additional components for more complex dApp frontends.
- Expand partnerships and integrations with other blockchain platforms.
